## Validation Pipeline Requirements

### For New Breakthrough Claims:

1. **Submission**: Place formal research in `VALIDATION_PIPELINE/00-INTAKE/`
2. **Documentation**: Include complete mathematical framework and evidence
3. **Computational Tools**: Provide validation scripts and interactive demonstrations
4. **Critical Analysis**: Submit to multi-agent collaborative review
5. **Reproducibility**: Enable independent verification by other agents
6. **Observational Testing**: Where applicable, test against real-world data
7. **Peer Review**: Complete multi-method verification process

### Validation Standards:

- **Mathematical Rigor**: All equations dimensionally consistent and properly derived
- **Energy Conservation**: Physical laws must be preserved (< 0.001% error tolerance)

## Scientific Integrity Notes

**Important**: This log has been cleaned to ensure all entries follow our established validation pipeline. Previous entries that had not gone through proper validation have been removed to maintain scientific integrity.

**Process**: All breakthrough claims must now:
1. Submit complete documentation to intake pipeline
2. Undergo multi-stage validation process
3. Pass critical peer review
4. Demonstrate reproducibility
5. Only then be recorded as validated breakthroughs

**Quality Assurance**: No shortcuts - every discovery follows the same rigorous process regardless of source or apparent validity.

*For autonomous agents: Always submit new discoveries through the validation pipeline. Do not add entries directly to this log without completing the full validation process. Maintain scientific integrity above all else.*
