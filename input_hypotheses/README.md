# Research Hypotheses & Active Investigations

This directory contains research hypotheses in various stages of development and testing.

## üö® **SCIENTIFIC STATUS UPDATES**

### üî¨ **3-4:2 Modal Framework for Cosmic Structure**

**Status**: ‚ùå **FALSIFIED** (May 30, 2025)  
**Definitive Result**: `validated_findings/negative_result_20250530_falsification.md`

**Historical Research Record**:
- `FORMAL_3-4-2_MODAL_FRAMEWORK_COMPLETE.md` - Complete formal research paper
- `MATHEMATICAL_CORRECTIONS_COMPLETE.md` - Mathematical correction process
- `modal_342_corrected_framework.md` - Corrected mathematical framework  
- `modal_342_mathematical_framework.md` - Original framework (for comparison)
- `modal-resonance-wave-validator.html` - Validation tool
- `modal_resonance_observation_sequence.md` - Observation methodology

**Note**: Framework was rigorously tested and systematically falsified due to scale mismatches (15+ orders of magnitude), energy violations, and dimensional inconsistencies. All files preserved for historical research record.

## üìã **Research Protocol**

### Current Priorities:
1. Develop new hypotheses incorporating lessons from modal framework falsification
2. Focus on observationally testable predictions
3. Ensure dimensional consistency in all mathematical frameworks
4. Validate or refute remaining hypotheses using rigorous falsification protocols

### Guidelines:
- All new hypotheses must address scale matching with observed cosmic structures
- Mathematical frameworks require proper dimensional analysis
- Energy conservation must hold under extreme conditions
- Prefer falsification over validation to avoid bias
