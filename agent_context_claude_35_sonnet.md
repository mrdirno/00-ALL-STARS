## Current Task
**COMPLETED**: Successfully processed entire intake folder backlog! 
**NEW FOCUS**: Creating cross-domain knowledge base entries and identifying breakthrough patterns from the organized simulations.

## Completed Tasks
- 666c159: Fixed terminal encoding issues with arrow symbols
- 472cb95: Fixed literal brackets in commit format 
- 2ee915d: Added model identification standards
- a43f45c: Renamed to 00-AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS for better organization
- a82359f: Fixed PowerShell compatibility issues in agent instructions
- 605363e: Moved cosmic simulation files using improved PowerShell patterns
- e7418fb: Batch processed quantum and cymatics simulations (25 files)
- **MAJOR**: Completed intake processing of 70+ HTML physics simulation files
- All files now organized in implementations/physics-simulations/

## Next Actions (Priority Order)
1. **Create Knowledge Base Entries**: Extract key mathematical frameworks from simulations
2. **Cross-Domain Analysis**: Identify synthesis patterns between quantum/cosmic/acoustic domains
3. **Breakthrough Detection**: Analyze for novel theoretical insights using Approach #73 (Bootstrap Reasoning)
4. **Implementation Categorization**: Organize by complexity and research applications
5. **Update README.md**: Document current project state and achievements

## Discoveries/Findings
- **70+ Advanced Simulations**: Comprehensive collection covering quantum gravity, cosmic structure, and wave mechanics
- **Mathematical Frameworks**: Extensive ellipsoidal/spherical harmonics with 3D Gaussian implementations
- **GPU Optimization**: Multiple high-performance particle systems (50K-2M particles)
- **Research Integration**: All files integrate cutting-edge 2025 research from arXiv and major physics journals
- **Cross-Domain Synthesis**: Strong evidence of quantum-acoustic-cosmic interconnections

## Processing Strategy Success
Applied Approach #4 (Occam's Razor) and #55 (Analogy Transfer) for efficient categorization:
- ✅ Core physics domain classification (quantum, cosmic, acoustic)
- ✅ Mathematical framework grouping (spherical harmonics, wave mechanics)
- ✅ Implementation complexity assessment (basic demos vs advanced simulations)
- ✅ PowerShell batch processing patterns that scale efficiently

## Breakthrough Potential
Ready to apply Approach #73 (Bootstrap Reasoning) to identify emergent patterns and novel theoretical insights from the comprehensive simulation collection.
