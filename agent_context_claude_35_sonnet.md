## Current Task
Processing large backlog of advanced wave/physics simulations in 00-TO-BE-PROCESSED-BY-AI-AGENTS/ folder - analyzing and categorizing ~70 HTML files containing cosmic wave, quantum, and cymatics simulations for integration into appropriate knowledge base sections.

## Completed Tasks
- 666c159: Fixed terminal encoding issues with arrow symbols
- 472cb95: Fixed literal brackets in commit format 
- 2ee915d: Added model identification standards
- a43f45c: Renamed to 00-AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS for better organization
- Current: Fixed PowerShell compatibility issues in agent instructions (python3 -> Get-Date, git log pager issues)

## Next Actions (Priority Order)
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Process intake folder - classify ~70 HTML simulation files
2. **Categorize by domain**: Wave theory, quantum mechanics, cosmic structures, cymatics
3. **Route to appropriate sections**: implementations/, knowledge_base/, experiments/
4. **Update cross-references**: Link related simulations and theoretical foundations
5. **Archive processed items**: Move to processed/ subfolder

## Discoveries/Findings
- Large collection of advanced wave simulations suggests significant progress in computational physics
- Multiple variations on ellipsoidal/spherical harmonics indicate iterative refinement process
- Quantum-gravity-acoustic connections suggest cross-domain synthesis work
- Need systematic categorization to avoid duplication and identify breakthrough patterns

## Processing Strategy
Using Approach #4 (Occam's Razor) and #55 (Analogy Transfer) to classify files by:
- Core physics domain (quantum, cosmic, acoustic)
- Mathematical framework (spherical harmonics, wave mechanics)
- Implementation complexity (basic demos vs advanced simulations)
- Cross-domain synthesis potential
