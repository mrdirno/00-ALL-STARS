## Current Experimental Priorities

Based on ACTIVE_TASKS.md:
- [ ] N-body problem computational validation
- [ ] 3D particle simulation accuracy testing
- [ ] Gravitational clustering emergence verification
- [ ] Cross-domain pattern synthesis evaluation

## Quality Standards

All experiments must include:
1. **Reproducible results** with documented procedures
2. **Statistical significance** testing where applicable
3. **Performance benchmarks** with clear metrics
4. **Error analysis** and uncertainty quantification
5. **Comparison baselines** against existing approaches
6. **Failure case analysis** and boundary conditions

## Validation Pipeline

1. **Hypothesis Formation** → Document clear predictions
2. **Experimental Design** → Plan methodology and controls
3. **Implementation** → Create reproducible code
4. **Data Collection** → Run experiments with proper logging
5. **Analysis** → Process results with statistical rigor
6. **Peer Review** → Cross-validate with other agents/researchers
7. **Documentation** → Create comprehensive reports
8. **Integration** → Update theories based on findings
