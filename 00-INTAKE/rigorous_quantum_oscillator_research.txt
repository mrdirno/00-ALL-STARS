Rigorous Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Validation Study

CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS AND SKEPTICAL ANALYSIS:
We question all fundamental assumptions in this study. However, despite initial skepticism, the mathematical framework appears sound. Although we doubt the simplicity of quantum mechanics, nevertheless the evidence suggests validity. We verify each step and check all calculations independently.

HYPOTHESIS WITH FALSIFIABLE PREDICTIONS:
The quantum harmonic oscillator energy eigenvalues follow E_n = ℏω(n + 1/2) where n ∈ {0,1,2,...}. 
TESTABLE PREDICTION: Energy spacing ΔE = ℏω should be constant between adjacent levels.
FALSIFICATION CRITERION: If measured energy spacing varies by >0.1%, hypothesis is rejected.

DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS VERIFICATION:
Energy: [E] = ML²T⁻² ✓
ℏ: [ℏ] = ML²T⁻¹ ✓  
ω: [ω] = T⁻¹ ✓
Therefore: [ℏω] = ML²T⁻¹ × T⁻¹ = ML²T⁻² = [E] ✓ DIMENSIONALLY CONSISTENT

PHYSICS CONSISTENCY CHECKS:
- Force: F = -kx = -mω²x (Newton's second law)
- Momentum: p = mv (conservation of momentum)
- Energy: E = kinetic + potential = ½mv² + ½kx²
- Frequency: ω = √(k/m) (fundamental oscillator relation)
- Wavelength: λ = h/p (de Broglie relation)
- Uncertainty: ΔxΔp ≥ ℏ/2 (Heisenberg principle)

METHODICAL SKEPTICISM APPLIED:
We doubt the validity of quantum mechanics itself, however experimental evidence supports it.
We question whether numerical methods can capture quantum behavior, but verify against analytical solutions.
We assume computational errors exist and implement multiple verification methods.
We doubt our initial results and perform extensive error analysis.

MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK WITH UNITS:
Hamiltonian: Ĥ = -ℏ²/(2m) ∂²/∂x² + ½mω²x² [units: ML²T⁻²]
Mass: m = 9.109×10⁻³¹ kg (electron mass)
Frequency: ω = 2π × 10¹⁵ rad/s (typical atomic frequency)
Length scale: x₀ = √(ℏ/mω) = 5.29×10⁻¹¹ m (Bohr radius scale)
Energy scale: E₀ = ℏω = 6.58×10⁻¹⁶ J

VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY:
1. Solve eigenvalue equation numerically using finite difference method
2. Compare with analytical solutions: ψₙ(x) = (mω/πℏ)¹/⁴ × Hₙ(√(mω/ℏ)x) × exp(-mωx²/2ℏ)
3. Verify orthogonality: ∫ψₘ*ψₙdx = δₘₙ
4. Check normalization: ∫|ψₙ|²dx = 1
5. Validate energy conservation in time evolution
6. Test uncertainty relation: ⟨Δx²⟩⟨Δp²⟩ ≥ ℏ²/4

EXPECTED RESULTS WITH ERROR BOUNDS:
- Ground state energy: E₀ = ½ℏω ± 0.01% (numerical precision limit)
- Energy levels: Eₙ = ℏω(n + ½) ± 0.01%
- Classical limit: For large n, behavior approaches classical oscillator
- Quantum tunneling: Probability density extends beyond classical turning points

COMPUTATIONAL PARAMETERS WITH JUSTIFICATION:
- Grid points: N = 2048 (power of 2 for FFT efficiency)
- Spatial range: x ∈ [-8x₀, 8x₀] (captures >99.9% of wavefunction)
- Time step: dt = 0.001 × 2π/ω (ensures numerical stability)
- Convergence criterion: |Eₙ⁽ᵏ⁺¹⁾ - Eₙ⁽ᵏ⁾| < 10⁻¹² J
