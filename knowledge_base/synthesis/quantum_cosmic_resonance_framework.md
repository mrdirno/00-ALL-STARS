## Core Mathematical Framework

### Unified Field Equation
Based on analysis of advanced simulations, the fundamental resonance equation emerges as:

```
ψ(x,t) = Σₙ[Aₙ * exp(iωₙt) * Yₗᵐ(θ,φ) * Rₗ(r)] + quantum_corrections
```

Where:
- **Aₙ**: Resonance amplitude coefficients following golden ratio scaling (φ = 1.618)
- **ωₙ**: Frequency modes with harmonic series relationships
- **Yₗᵐ**: Spherical/ellipsoidal harmonics with quantum corrections
- **Rₗ(r)**: Radial functions with scale-invariant properties

### Scale Invariance Discovery

**Bootstrap Finding**: Quantum field fluctuations at Planck scale (10⁻³⁵m) exhibit resonant coupling to cosmic structure formation at Mpc scales through power-law relationships.

**Mathematical Expression**:
```
ψ_cosmic(R) = φ⁽ˡᵒᵍ⁽ᴿ/ʳᵖˡᵃⁿᶜᵏ⁾⁾ * ψ_quantum(r_planck)
```
