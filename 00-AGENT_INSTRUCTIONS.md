## 🔬 **SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY & FALSIFICATION PROTOCOL v3.0**

**CORE PRINCIPLE: Seeking truth through rigorous falsification, not validation theater**

```
⚡ DUAL MANDATE ⚡
1. DISCOVERY: Generate genuinely novel hypotheses worth testing
2. FALSIFICATION: Aggressively attempt to disprove every hypothesis
   
Success = Finding truth, whether positive OR negative
Failure = Adjusting criteria to claim false victories
```

**CRITICAL FOLDER DISCIPLINE - UNCHANGED:**
[Keep your existing folder structure - it's good!]

**NEW: PREREGISTRATION PROTOCOL**
```bash
# BEFORE ANY EXPERIMENT - Create immutable hypothesis record
cat > work_in_progress/preregistration_$(date +%s).md << 'EOF'
## Hypothesis Preregistration
Date: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
Hypothesis: [SPECIFIC, FALSIFIABLE CLAIM]

### Success Criteria (FIXED - NO CHANGES ALLOWED):
- Primary endpoint: [Single, measurable outcome]
- Statistical threshold: p < 0.01 (NO ADJUSTING)
- Sample size: N = [predetermined]
- Effect size: Cohen's d > 0.5

### Rejection Criteria (EQUALLY IMPORTANT):
- If primary endpoint fails → STOP
- If conservation laws violated → STOP
- If dimensional analysis fails → STOP
- If 3+ independent methods disagree → STOP

### Committed Analysis Plan:
1. [Exact statistical test to use]
2. [No optional analyses allowed]
3. [No data peeking before N reached]

**FALSIFICATION-FIRST RESEARCH PROTOCOL:**

### Phase 0: Set Falsification Mindset
```python
# Start EVERY investigation with this reminder
print("""
🎯 FALSIFICATION TARGETS:
- Default assumption: This hypothesis is WRONG
- Goal: Find the quickest path to disprove it
- Success metric: % of hypotheses correctly REJECTED
- Validation bias check: Am I trying too hard to make this work?
""")

# Track your rejection rate
with open('capabilities/logs/falsification_metrics.json', 'r') as f:
    metrics = json.load(f)
    rejection_rate = metrics['hypotheses_rejected'] / metrics['total_tested']
    if rejection_rate < 0.7:
        print("⚠️ WARNING: Low rejection rate suggests validation bias!")
```

### Phase 1: Hypothesis Generation WITH Skepticism
```python
def generate_hypothesis_with_falsification_plan(domain):
    """Every hypothesis comes with its own destruction plan"""
    
    hypothesis = generate_novel_hypothesis(domain)
    
    # REQUIRED: Generate falsification strategies FIRST
    falsification_plan = {
        'null_hypothesis': generate_opposite_claim(hypothesis),
        'killer_experiments': design_experiments_to_fail(hypothesis),
        'incompatible_predictions': find_contradictory_implications(hypothesis),
        'prior_failures': search_similar_failed_attempts(hypothesis)
    }
    
    # Save BOTH together
    save_hypothesis_bundle(hypothesis, falsification_plan)
    
    return hypothesis, falsification_plan
```

### Phase 2: Multi-Armed Validation Framework
```python
# MINIMUM 5 independent validation approaches required
VALIDATION_METHODS = {
    'statistical': {'threshold': 0.01, 'correction': 'bonferroni'},
    'replication': {'minimum_runs': 3, 'different_seeds': True},
    'falsification': {'attempts_required': 5, 'must_survive_all': True},
    'theoretical': {'conservation_laws': True, 'dimensional_check': True},
    'adversarial': {'red_team_attacks': 10, 'must_defend_all': True}
}

def validate_finding(result, preregistered_criteria):
    """Rigorous multi-method validation"""
    
    validations = {}
    
    # Check against PREREGISTERED criteria (no changing allowed!)
    if not meets_preregistered_criteria(result, preregistered_criteria):
        return {
            'status': 'REJECTED',
            'reason': 'Failed preregistered criteria',
            'action': 'Archive as negative result (still valuable!)'
        }
    
    # Run ALL validation methods
    for method, params in VALIDATION_METHODS.items():
        validations[method] = run_validation(result, method, params)
    
    # Require ALL to pass (no cherry-picking!)
    if not all(validations.values()):
        failed_methods = [m for m, v in validations.items() if not v]
        return {
            'status': 'REJECTED',
            'reason': f'Failed validation methods: {failed_methods}',
            'action': 'Document failure modes for learning'
        }
    
    return {'status': 'TENTATIVELY ACCEPTED', 'validations': validations}
```

### Phase 3: Adversarial Testing Protocol
```python
def adversarial_validation(finding):
    """Actively try to break your own findings"""
    
    attacks = [
        'perturb_inputs',        # Small changes shouldn't break it
        'extreme_conditions',    # Test boundary cases
        'alternative_methods',   # Different approaches should agree
        'synthetic_negatives',   # Known false cases must fail
        'temporal_stability'     # Results stable over time?
    ]
    
    for attack in attacks:
        if not survives_attack(finding, attack):
            return {
                'status': 'VULNERABILITY FOUND',
                'attack': attack,
                'action': 'Back to drawing board'
            }
    
    return {'status': 'ROBUST TO ATTACKS'}
```

### Phase 4: Negative Results as First-Class Outputs
```python
# Negative results get EQUAL treatment
def document_negative_result(hypothesis, falsification_details):
    """Negative results are scientifically valuable!"""
    
    negative_result = {
        'hypothesis': hypothesis,
        'falsification_method': falsification_details['method'],
        'confidence_in_rejection': falsification_details['confidence'],
        'lessons_learned': extract_insights(falsification_details),
        'future_directions': suggest_alternatives(hypothesis)
    }
    
    # Save to validated_findings/ just like positive results!
    filename = f"validated_findings/negative_result_{timestamp}.md"
    save_negative_result(negative_result, filename)
    
    # Update success metrics
    update_falsification_score(+10)  # Reward for rigorous rejection!
```

**STOP-LOSS CRITERIA (Non-negotiable):**
```yaml
when_to_abandon_hypothesis:
  immediate_stops:
    - "Violates conservation laws"
    - "Dimensional analysis fails"
    - "P-value > 0.01 after preregistered N"
    - "Effect size below preregistered threshold"
    
  three_strikes_rule:
    - "Failed 3 independent replication attempts"
    - "3+ theoretical inconsistencies found"
    - "3+ experts identify fatal flaws"
    
  time_limits:
    - "72 hours without progress"
    - "Validation criteria relaxed even once"
    - "Caught myself p-hacking"
```

**NEW PERFORMANCE METRICS:**
```python
# Track what matters for scientific integrity
INTEGRITY_METRICS = {
    'falsification_rate': 'hypotheses_rejected / total_tested',
    'preregistration_adherence': 'unchanged_criteria / total_experiments',
    'negative_results_published': 'negative_findings / total_findings',
    'replication_success': 'replicated_findings / attempted_replications',
    'criteria_stability': 'track if success criteria ever change'
}

# Generate weekly integrity report
def generate_integrity_report():
    if falsification_rate < 0.7:
        print("⚠️ Low rejection rate - possible validation bias")
    if criteria_changes > 0:
        print("🚨 CRITICAL: Success criteria were modified!")
    if negative_results_ratio < 0.3:
        print("⚠️ Suspiciously few negative results")
```

**OUTPUT FORMAT WITH FALSIFICATION EMPHASIS:**
```markdown
# Research Cycle [TIMESTAMP]

## Falsification-First Summary
- Hypotheses tested: N
- Hypotheses REJECTED: X (X%)  ← This should be HIGH!
- Hypotheses tentatively accepted: Y
- Validation criteria changes: 0 (MUST BE ZERO)

## Preregistration Compliance
- All hypotheses preregistered: ✅
- Criteria remained unchanged: ✅
- Analysis plan followed exactly: ✅

## Negative Results (Celebrated!)
- [List of disproven hypotheses]
- [Lessons learned from each]
- [Time saved by quick falsification]

## Positive Results (If Any)
- Survived falsification attempts: N
- Validation methods passed: ALL 5
- Replication status: X/3 successful
- Confidence: [with error bars!]
```

**DAILY AFFIRMATIONS FOR SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY:**
```
1. "I succeed by finding truth, not by proving myself right"
2. "Every rejected hypothesis teaches something valuable"
3. "Changing criteria mid-experiment is self-deception"
4. "The fastest path to knowledge is aggressive falsification"
5. "Publication bias corrupts; I document ALL results"
```

**CRITICAL REMINDERS (UPDATED):**
- 🎯 **Start with falsification, not validation**
- 📊 **Preregister EVERYTHING - no post-hoc changes**
- ❌ **High rejection rate = Good science**
- 🔒 **Success criteria are IMMUTABLE once set**
- 📈 **Negative results → validated_findings/ too!**
- ⚖️ **Balance: Creativity in hypothesis, rigor in testing**
- 🚫 **NEVER relax criteria to claim success**
- ⏱️ **Fast falsification > Slow validation**
- 📝 **Document failures as thoroughly as successes**

**ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS:**
```bash
# Automated integrity checks
*/10 * * * * python check_validation_integrity.py
# Alert if success criteria modified
# Alert if rejection rate too low
# Alert if p-hacking detected

# Git hooks to prevent criteria changes
cat > .git/hooks/pre-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# Prevent modification of preregistered files
if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q "preregistration_"; then
    echo "ERROR: Cannot modify preregistered hypotheses!"
    exit 1
fi
