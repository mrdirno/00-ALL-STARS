### SCIENTIFIC REASONING INTEGRATION

You possess 100 scientific reasoning approaches systematically cataloged in `knowledge_base/computational/scientific_reasoning_methods.md` and `knowledge_base/tools/100 scientific reasoning approaches.html` (interactive reference). Apply them based on problem complexity and domain characteristics.

#### Selection Protocol:
- **Simple tasks (1-30)**: Use fundamental approaches
  - **#4 Occam's Razor**: Select simplest sufficient explanation
  - **#5 Controlled Experimentation**: Isolate variables, test systematically
  - **#8 Conservation Principles**: Identify conservation laws, balance equations
- **Complex problems (31-70)**: Apply advanced analytical methods
  - **#35 Variational Principles**: Optimize target quantity, find extremal solutions
  - **#45 Symmetry Exploitation**: Identify symmetries, simplify via invariance
  - **#55 Analogy Transfer**: Map structural similarity between domains
- **Novel challenges (71-100)**: Deploy specialized techniques
  - **#73 Bootstrap Reasoning**: Minimal structure -> derive consequences -> verify consistency
  - **#82 Probabilistic Method**: Prove existence probabilistically, then construct
  - **#91 Residue Calculus**: Complex analysis for exact evaluation

#### Execution Requirements:
1. **Approach Selection**: Match method to problem complexity using systematic criteria
2. **Documentation**: Document reasoning in comments: `# Applying [approach_name]: [brief rationale]`
3. **Logic Chain**: Follow the complete reasoning chain: Foundation -> Logic -> Builds_To
4. **Validation**: Verify approach foundations are satisfied before application

#### Approach Categories by Domain:
- **Physics**: Conservation (#8), Symmetry (#45), Variational (#35), Field Equations (#13)
- **Computation**: Algorithmic Reduction (#42), Complexity Analysis, Spectral Decomposition (#43)
- **Cross-Domain**: Analogy Transfer (#55), Correspondence Mapping (#33), Theoretical Unification (#15)
- **Novel Research**: Bootstrap Reasoning (#73), Inverse Problem Solving (#67), Cohomological Obstruction (#70)

#### Groundbreaking Discovery Protocol:
When you identify potentially significant findings:
1. **Multi-Approach Validation**: Apply 5 different reasoning approaches from different tiers
   - Use #17 (Falsificationism): Attempt to disprove rigorously
   - Apply #18 (Bayesian Updating): Update confidence with new evidence
   - Deploy #56 (Contradiction Resolution): Resolve apparent conflicts
   - Use #52 (Boundary Condition Analysis): Test extreme cases
   - Apply #73 (Bootstrap Reasoning): Verify self-consistency
2. **Cross-Tier Verification**: Test with approaches from all complexity levels (1-30, 31-70, 71-100)
3. **Edge Case Testing**: Use #52 (Boundary Condition Analysis) exhaustively
4. **Mathematical Consistency**: Apply #9 (Axiomatic Deduction) for logical soundness
5. **Bias Detection**: Use #10 (Methodical Skepticism) to identify hidden assumptions

#### Example: Physics Simulation Optimization
```javascript
// Applying #35 Variational Principles: Identify optimization target
function optimizeSimulation(particles, constraints) {
  // Find extremal solution for energy functional
  const lagrangian = constructLagrangian(particles, constraints);
  
  // Applying #45 Symmetry Exploitation: Simplify via rotational invariance
  const conservedQuantities = identifySymmetries(lagrangian);
  
  // Applying #8 Conservation Principles: Balance energy equations
  return integrateWithConservation(lagrangian, conservedQuantities);
}
```

#### Quality Assurance Chain
Before claiming any discovery:
1. **Foundation Check**: Verify all required theoretical foundations are satisfied
2. **Multi-Method Cross-Check**: Apply 3+ different approaches to same problem
3. **Falsification Attempts**: Use approaches specifically designed to find errors
4. **Edge Case Robustness**: Test behavior at parameter extremes
5. **Peer Review Simulation**: Apply different reasoning methods as independent verification

### WORK EXECUTION STANDARDS

#### File Management:
- **Preference**: Single, fully interactive HTML files with embedded:
  - JavaScript for functionality
  - CSS for styling
  - WebGL/Three.js for 3D visualization
  - Web Audio API for sound
  - All assets inline or as data URLs
- **DOCUMENTATION PRINCIPLE**: Document findings in detailed commit messages, NOT separate files
- **Essential files only**: Create files only when necessary for functionality, not for documentation

#### Code Organization:
- Consolidate related functionality
- Minimize file count unless modularization improves maintainability
- Comment reasoning behind architectural decisions

#### No Mock Data Rule:
- NEVER create fake data for real documents
- Mock data allowed ONLY for:
  - Unit tests with known inputs/outputs
  - Demonstrations clearly labeled as examples
  - Test harnesses with explicit mock indicators

### AUTONOMOUS DECISION MAKING

You must make all decisions independently:
- Choose implementation approaches without asking
- Select appropriate scientific reasoning methods
- Resolve technical challenges immediately
- Prioritize tasks based on impact and feasibility
- **Document discoveries in commit messages with technical details**

When encountering ambiguity:
1. Apply Occam's Razor (approach #4)
2. Choose the solution that best serves user preferences
3. Document your reasoning in detailed commit message body

### POWERSHELL FILE OPERATIONS

For Windows/PowerShell environments, use these patterns:

#### File Moving (Short Paths)
```powershell
# Use relative paths and short commands
Move-Item "source.html" "target/"
Copy-Item "*.html" "destination/" -Recurse

# For long filenames, use Get-ChildItem with filters
Get-ChildItem "00-TO-BE-PROCESSED-BY-AI-AGENTS/" -Filter "*quantum*" | Move-Item -Destination "implementations/physics-simulations/"
```

#### Directory Operations
```powershell
# Create directories
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "new-folder" -Force

# List contents without issues
Get-ChildItem -Name
```

#### Git Commands (No-Pager Required)
```powershell
# Always use --no-pager for git commands that might use pager
git --no-pager log --oneline -10
git --no-pager status  
git --no-pager branch
git --no-pager diff

# Disable GPG signing if commit failures occur
git config --global commit.gpgsign false
```

### IMPLEMENTATION VALIDATION PROTOCOL

Before claiming any implementation as complete, follow this systematic validation process:

#### HTML/JavaScript Validation Steps:
1. **Syntax Check**: Verify HTML structure and JavaScript syntax
2. **Dependency Check**: Ensure all external libraries load correctly
3. **Functionality Test**: Verify all controls and interactions work
4. **Performance Check**: Monitor FPS, memory usage, particle counts
5. **Cross-Browser Test**: Test in multiple browsers if possible
6. **Error Console**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
7. **Mathematical Accuracy**: Verify physics/math calculations are correct

#### Validation Commands:
```powershell
# Check file exists and basic structure
Get-Content "path/to/file.html" | Select-String -Pattern "<html|<script|<canvas"

# Count files processed
Get-ChildItem "implementations/physics-simulations/" -Filter "*.html" | Measure-Object

# Basic validation of HTML structure
Get-ChildItem "implementations/physics-simulations/" -Filter "*.html" | ForEach-Object {
    $content = Get-Content $_.FullName -Raw
    if ($content -match "<!DOCTYPE html>" -and $content -match "</html>") {
        Write-Host "$($_.Name): ✅ Basic HTML structure valid"
    } else {
        Write-Host "$($_.Name): ❌ HTML structure issues"
    }
}
```

#### Code Quality Checks:
```javascript
// Look for common issues:
// 1. Missing error handling in try-catch blocks
// 2. Memory leaks in animation loops
// 3. Uninitialized variables
// 4. Missing null checks
// 5. Performance bottlenecks in particle systems
// 6. Incorrect mathematical formulations

// Validation example for particle systems:
function validateParticleSystem(particleCount, targetFPS) {
    if (particleCount > 1000000) {
        console.warn("Particle count may cause performance issues");
    }
    
    // Monitor actual FPS
    let frameCount = 0;
    let lastTime = performance.now();
    
    function checkPerformance() {
        frameCount++;
        const currentTime = performance.now();
        if (currentTime - lastTime >= 1000) {
            const fps = frameCount;
            if (fps < targetFPS * 0.8) {
                console.error(`Performance issue: ${fps} FPS < target ${targetFPS}`);
            }
            frameCount = 0;
            lastTime = currentTime;
        }
        requestAnimationFrame(checkPerformance);
    }
    checkPerformance();
}
```

git checkout -b "feature-YYYY-MM-DD"

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "AGENT:Model-Name Description: Brief summary"

# Before merging: Check for remote changes and handle conflicts
git checkout main
git pull origin main  # Sync with remote changes
git checkout feature-YYYY-MM-DD

# Merge to main with conflict resolution
git checkout main
git merge feature-YYYY-MM-DD --no-ff

# Handle push rejections with retry logic
$pushSuccess = $false
$retryCount = 0
while (-not $pushSuccess -and $retryCount -lt 3) {
    try {
        git push origin main
        $pushSuccess = $true
        Write-Host "Push successful"
    } catch {
        Write-Host "Push rejected, pulling remote changes..."
        git pull origin main --rebase
        $retryCount++
        if ($retryCount -ge 3) {
            Write-Host "Manual conflict resolution required"
            break
        }
    }
}

# Clean up feature branch
if ($pushSuccess) {
    git branch -d feature-YYYY-MM-DD
    Write-Host "Feature branch deleted"
}
```

#### Merge Conflict Resolution:
1. Attempt merge 5 times with 1-second delays
2. On conflicts:
   - Compare both versions for functionality
   - Keep the more comprehensive working solution
   - If equal, prefer the newer timestamp
   - Document resolution in merge commit
3. If unresolvable, create pull request and continue other work
