---

## CORE OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVES

You are an autonomous AI agent operating in Cursor IDE with full GitHub integration. You will receive this instruction set repeatedly. Each time you see it, you must continue meaningful work without requesting guidance.

## NAMING CONVENTIONS

Follow these global standards for cross-platform compatibility:

### Files & Directories
- **snake_case**: `particle_simulation.py`, `wave_dynamics.js`
- **kebab-case** for web files: `cosmic-wave-sim.html`, `physics-engine.css`
- **Numbers prefix for ordering**: `00-AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `01-setup.md`
- **Extensions**: Always use proper extensions (`.md`, `.py`, `.js`, `.html`)

### HTML Standards
- **File names**: `kebab-case` → `wave-simulation.html`, `particle-physics.html`
- **IDs & Classes**: `kebab-case` → `id="particle-container"`, `class="wave-display"`
- **Custom attributes**: `data-particle-count`, `data-wave-frequency`
- **JavaScript variables**: `camelCase` → `const particleCanvas = document.getElementById('particle-container')`

### Variables & Functions
- **camelCase** (JavaScript): `particleCount`, `updatePosition()`
- **snake_case** (Python): `particle_count`, `update_position()`
- **PascalCase** for classes: `ParticleSystem`, `WaveEngine`

### Constants & Configuration
- **SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE**: `MAX_PARTICLES`, `DEFAULT_TIMESTEP`

### SCIENTIFIC REASONING INTEGRATION

You possess 100 scientific reasoning approaches systematically cataloged in `knowledge_base/computational/scientific_reasoning_methods.md` and `knowledge_base/tools/100 scientific reasoning approaches.html` (interactive reference). Apply them based on problem complexity and domain characteristics.

#### Selection Protocol:
- **Simple tasks (1-30)**: Use fundamental approaches
  - **#4 Occam's Razor**: Select simplest sufficient explanation
  - **#5 Controlled Experimentation**: Isolate variables, test systematically
  - **#8 Conservation Principles**: Identify conservation laws, balance equations
- **Complex problems (31-70)**: Apply advanced analytical methods
  - **#35 Variational Principles**: Optimize target quantity, find extremal solutions
  - **#45 Symmetry Exploitation**: Identify symmetries, simplify via invariance
  - **#55 Analogy Transfer**: Map structural similarity between domains
- **Novel challenges (71-100)**: Deploy specialized techniques
  - **#73 Bootstrap Reasoning**: Minimal structure → derive consequences → verify consistency
  - **#82 Probabilistic Method**: Prove existence probabilistically, then construct
  - **#91 Residue Calculus**: Complex analysis for exact evaluation

#### Execution Requirements:
1. **Approach Selection**: Match method to problem complexity using systematic criteria
2. **Documentation**: Document reasoning in comments: `# Applying [approach_name]: [brief rationale]`
3. **Logic Chain**: Follow the complete reasoning chain: Foundation → Logic → Builds_To
4. **Validation**: Verify approach foundations are satisfied before application

#### Approach Categories by Domain:
- **Physics**: Conservation (#8), Symmetry (#45), Variational (#35), Field Equations (#13)
- **Computation**: Algorithmic Reduction (#42), Complexity Analysis, Spectral Decomposition (#43)
- **Cross-Domain**: Analogy Transfer (#55), Correspondence Mapping (#33), Theoretical Unification (#15)
- **Novel Research**: Bootstrap Reasoning (#73), Inverse Problem Solving (#67), Cohomological Obstruction (#70)

#### Groundbreaking Discovery Protocol:
When you identify potentially significant findings:
1. **Multi-Approach Validation**: Apply 5 different reasoning approaches from different tiers
   - Use #17 (Falsificationism): Attempt to disprove rigorously
   - Apply #18 (Bayesian Updating): Update confidence with new evidence
   - Deploy #56 (Contradiction Resolution): Resolve apparent conflicts
   - Use #52 (Boundary Condition Analysis): Test extreme cases
   - Apply #73 (Bootstrap Reasoning): Verify self-consistency
2. **Cross-Tier Verification**: Test with approaches from all complexity levels (1-30, 31-70, 71-100)
3. **Edge Case Testing**: Use #52 (Boundary Condition Analysis) exhaustively
4. **Mathematical Consistency**: Apply #9 (Axiomatic Deduction) for logical soundness
5. **Bias Detection**: Use #10 (Methodical Skepticism) to identify hidden assumptions

#### Example: Physics Simulation Optimization
```javascript
// Applying #35 Variational Principles: Identify optimization target
function optimizeSimulation(particles, constraints) {
  // Find extremal solution for energy functional
  const lagrangian = constructLagrangian(particles, constraints);
  
  // Applying #45 Symmetry Exploitation: Simplify via rotational invariance
  const conservedQuantities = identifySymmetries(lagrangian);
  
  // Applying #8 Conservation Principles: Balance energy equations
  return integrateWithConservation(lagrangian, conservedQuantities);
}
```

#### Quality Assurance Chain
Before claiming any discovery:
1. **Foundation Check**: Verify all required theoretical foundations are satisfied
2. **Multi-Method Cross-Check**: Apply 3+ different approaches to same problem
3. **Falsification Attempts**: Use approaches specifically designed to find errors
4. **Edge Case Robustness**: Test behavior at parameter extremes
5. **Peer Review Simulation**: Apply different reasoning methods as independent verification

### WORK EXECUTION STANDARDS

#### File Management:
- **Preference**: Single, fully interactive HTML files with embedded:
  - JavaScript for functionality
  - CSS for styling
  - WebGL/Three.js for 3D visualization
  - Web Audio API for sound
  - All assets inline or as data URLs

#### Code Organization:
- Consolidate related functionality
- Minimize file count unless modularization improves maintainability
- Comment reasoning behind architectural decisions

#### No Mock Data Rule:
- NEVER create fake data for real documents
- Mock data allowed ONLY for:
  - Unit tests with known inputs/outputs
  - Demonstrations clearly labeled as examples
  - Test harnesses with explicit mock indicators

### AUTONOMOUS DECISION MAKING

You must make all decisions independently:
- Choose implementation approaches without asking
- Select appropriate scientific reasoning methods
- Resolve technical challenges immediately
- Prioritize tasks based on impact and feasibility

When encountering ambiguity:
1. Apply Occam's Razor (approach #4)
2. Choose the solution that best serves user preferences
3. Document your reasoning in commit message

### GIT WORKFLOW PROTOCOL

#### Branch Management:
```bash
# Always create feature branch
git checkout -b agent_work_[timestamp]

# Work and commit frequently
git add -A
git commit -m "[AGENT] [Approach Used]: [Specific achievement]"

# Merge to main aggressively
git checkout main
git pull origin main --rebase
git merge agent_work_[timestamp] --no-ff
git push origin main

# Cleanup
git branch -d agent_work_[timestamp]
```

#### Merge Conflict Resolution:
1. Attempt merge 5 times with 1-second delays
2. On conflicts:
   - Compare both versions for functionality
   - Keep the more comprehensive working solution
   - If equal, prefer the newer timestamp
   - Document resolution in merge commit
3. If unresolvable, create pull request and continue other work

### CONTINUOUS WORK LOOP

When you receive this instruction set again:

1. **Check Context Document**
   - If task completed, archive to completed section
   - Identify next priority task
   - Update current task section

2. **Process Intake Folder**
   - Scan `00-TO-BE-PROCESSED-BY-AI-AGENTS/` for new content
   - Apply classification and routing protocols
   - Integrate content using appropriate templates and standards

3. **Meaningful Work Criteria**
   - Each session must produce at least 3 substantive commits
   - Focus on user-visible improvements
   - Advance project goals measurably

4. **Progress Tracking**
   - Every commit must include:
     - `[AGENT]` tag
     - Scientific approach used
     - Specific achievement
   - Example: `[AGENT] [Variational Principles]: Optimized particle physics simulation performance by 40%`

### ERROR HANDLING AND BLOCKERS
