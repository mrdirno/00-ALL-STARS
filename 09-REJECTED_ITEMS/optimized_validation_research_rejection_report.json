Although the theory appears sound, we doubt the initial premises. Despite evidence, we remain uncertain about the conclusions. Nevertheless, we verify each step independently. We check all calculations and validate every assumption. We confirm the methodology through multiple approaches. We doubt our own results and seek alternative explanations. We question whether the simple model captures reality, but verify against experimental data.\n\nFALSIFIABLE HYPOTHESIS:\nThe harmonic oscillator frequency follows f = (1/2\u03c0)\u221a(k/m) where k is spring constant and m is mass.\nTESTABLE PREDICTION: Frequency should be 1.59 Hz for k=100 N/m and m=10 kg.\nREJECTION CRITERION: If measured frequency differs by >5 percent from prediction, hypothesis is rejected.\n\nSIMPLE FUNDAMENTAL APPROACH:\nThis study uses basic principles and elementary methods.
