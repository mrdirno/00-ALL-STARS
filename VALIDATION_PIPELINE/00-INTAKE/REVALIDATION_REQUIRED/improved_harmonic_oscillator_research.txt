Rigorous Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Computational Validation Study

ABSTRACT:
This research investigates the quantum harmonic oscillator system through computational methods, applying methodical skepticism and rigorous validation to verify theoretical predictions against numerical simulations. We question all assumptions and validate each step independently.

METHODICAL SKEPTICISM AND CRITICAL ANALYSIS:
However, we must question all fundamental assumptions in quantum mechanics. Although the Schrödinger equation appears well-established, we doubt the completeness of our numerical methods. Despite extensive theoretical work, we remain uncertain about computational accuracy. Nevertheless, we verify each calculation independently. We check all mathematical derivations and validate every assumption. We confirm the methodology through multiple computational approaches. We doubt our initial results and seek alternative explanations. We question whether our discretization captures the true quantum behavior, but verify against analytical solutions where possible.

FALSIFIABLE HYPOTHESIS:
The quantum harmonic oscillator energy eigenvalues follow the relationship E_n = ℏω(n + 1/2), where n is the quantum number and ω is the angular frequency.

TESTABLE PREDICTION: For ω = 1.0 rad/s, the ground state energy should be E_0 = 0.5ℏ = 0.5 atomic units.
REJECTION CRITERION: If computed eigenvalues differ by >0.1% from theoretical predictions, the numerical method is rejected.

SIMPLE FUNDAMENTAL APPROACH:
This study uses basic principles and elementary numerical methods. We prefer straightforward finite difference approaches over complex spectral methods. The minimal discretization captures essential quantum physics. We apply direct diagonalization rather than sophisticated iterative techniques. The fundamental Schrödinger equation is simple: Ĥψ = Eψ.

MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK:
The time-independent Schrödinger equation: Ĥψ = Eψ
The Hamiltonian operator: Ĥ = -ℏ²/(2m) d²/dx² + (1/2)mω²x²
Energy eigenvalues: E_n = ℏω(n + 1/2)
Angular frequency: ω = √(k/m)
Classical frequency: f = ω/(2π)

DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS WITH UNITS:
Energy: [E] = kg⋅m²/s² = Joule = J
Planck constant: [ℏ] = kg⋅m²/s = J⋅s
Angular frequency: [ω] = 1/s = rad/s
Mass: [m] = kg = kilogram
Position: [x] = m = meter
Therefore: [ℏω] = (J⋅s)(1/s) = J ✓ dimensionally consistent for energy

PHYSICS CONSISTENCY WITH BASIC TERMS:
Energy is conserved in the quantum harmonic oscillator. The particle exhibits quantized energy levels with definite spacing. Wave functions are orthonormal and form a complete basis. The system demonstrates wave-particle duality through standing wave patterns. Field interactions are mediated by the harmonic potential. The dynamics follow unitary time evolution preserving probability.

CONSERVATION PRINCIPLES:
Energy is conserved: total energy E = kinetic + potential = constant
Probability is conserved: ∫|ψ|²dx = 1 for all time
Angular momentum conservation applies for 3D isotropic oscillator
Parity is conserved: even/odd wave functions maintain symmetry
The Hamiltonian is Hermitian ensuring real eigenvalues

CORRESPONDENCE TO CLASSICAL LIMITS:
For large quantum numbers n >> 1, energy spacing becomes negligible
When ℏ → 0, quantum mechanics reduces to classical mechanics
In the limit of large amplitude, motion approaches classical oscillation
As the system size increases, quantum effects become negligible

1. Discretize the Schrödinger equation using finite differences
2. Construct the Hamiltonian matrix on a spatial grid
