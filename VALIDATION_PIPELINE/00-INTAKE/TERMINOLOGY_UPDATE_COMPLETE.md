# Terminology Update Complete: Bio-Cymatic ‚Üí Modal Resonance Model
## Scientific Terminology Correction Across Research Package

### ‚úÖ **UPDATE STATUS: COMPLETE**

The entire 3-4:2 research package has been systematically updated to replace scientifically inaccurate "bio-cymatic" terminology with the proper "Modal Resonance Model" designation.

---

## üéØ **Why This Change Was Necessary**

### **Scientific Accuracy Issues with "Bio-Cymatic"**
1. **"Bio" implies biological systems** - but research focuses on cosmic/astrophysical phenomena
2. **Potential reviewer confusion** - astronomers/cosmologists don't expect biological content
3. **Non-standard terminology** - not recognized in astrophysics literature
4. **Misleading classification** - could be categorized incorrectly in databases

### **Benefits of "Modal Resonance Model"**
1. **Scientifically precise** - accurately describes the wave-based mechanism
2. **Clear focus** - emphasizes the 3-4:2 modal pattern structure
3. **Standard terminology** - aligns with physics and engineering literature
4. **Peer review ready** - appropriate for astrophysics journals
