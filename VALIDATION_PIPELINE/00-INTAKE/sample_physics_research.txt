Sample Physics Research: Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Analysis

Abstract:
This research investigates the quantum harmonic oscillator system using computational methods to validate theoretical predictions against numerical simulations.

Hypothesis:
The quantum harmonic oscillator energy levels follow the relationship E_n = ℏω(n + 1/2), where n is the quantum number and ω is the angular frequency.

Methodology:
1. Solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation numerically
2. Compare eigenvalues with analytical predictions
3. Validate wave function orthogonality
4. Test energy conservation in time evolution

Mathematical Framework:
The Hamiltonian operator: Ĥ = -ℏ²/(2m) d²/dx² + (1/2)mω²x²

Expected Results:
- Energy levels should match theoretical predictions within 0.1% accuracy
- Wave functions should be orthonormal
- Time evolution should conserve total energy

Computational Parameters:
- Mass: m = 1.0 (atomic units)
- Frequency: ω = 1.0 rad/s
- Spatial grid: x ∈ [-10, 10] with 1000 points
- Time step: dt = 0.01

This research demonstrates fundamental quantum mechanical principles through rigorous computational validation.
