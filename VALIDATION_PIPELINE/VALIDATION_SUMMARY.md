## Execution Results

### Processing Statistics
- **Total Items Processed**: 75 physics simulation files
- **Processing Time**: 0.33 seconds total
- **Average Time per Item**: 0.004 seconds
- **Processing Rate**: 13,770 items per minute
- **Success Rate**: 100% (no errors)

### Validation Outcomes
- **Approved**: 0 items
- **Rejected**: 75 items (100%)
- **Errors**: 0 items

### Rejection Analysis
All items were rejected at **Stage 1: Initial Screening** because they failed to meet the 80% threshold for scientific reasoning methods. The framework correctly identified that:

1. **HTML/JavaScript files** contain code rather than formal scientific research
2. **No testable hypotheses** were present in the simulation files
3. **No formal scientific claims** requiring validation were found
4. **Equations extracted** were programming assignments rather than physics equations

This demonstrates the framework's **rigorous scientific standards** and **proper discrimination** between code implementations and formal scientific research.
