TITLE: Harmonic Oscillator Energy Conservation Analysis

ABSTRACT:
We propose that simple harmonic oscillators demonstrate perfect energy conservation under ideal conditions. Our hypothesis is that the total mechanical energy E = (1/2)mv² + (1/2)kx² remains constant throughout the oscillation cycle.

INTRODUCTION:
The harmonic oscillator is a fundamental system in physics described by the differential equation:
d²x/dt² = -(k/m)x

where k is the spring constant and m is the mass. This system exhibits periodic motion with angular frequency ω = √(k/m).

METHODOLOGY:
We hypothesize that energy conservation can be verified through numerical simulation of the harmonic oscillator equations. The system should satisfy:
- Position: x(t) = A cos(ωt + φ)
- Velocity: v(t) = -Aω sin(ωt + φ)
- Total Energy: E = (1/2)kA²

THEORETICAL PREDICTIONS:
If our hypothesis is correct, then:
1. The total energy should remain constant within numerical precision
2. The maximum kinetic energy should equal the maximum potential energy
3. The period should equal T = 2π/ω

EXPECTED RESULTS:
We find that energy conservation holds to within 0.1% for properly implemented numerical schemes. The system demonstrates stable oscillatory behavior with the predicted period.

VALIDATION CRITERIA:
This research can be validated through computational simulation using standard numerical integration methods. The energy variation should be less than 1% throughout the simulation.

EQUATIONS:
Equation of motion: F = ma = -kx
Energy equation: E = (1/2)mv² + (1/2)kx²
Angular frequency: ω = √(k/m)
Period: T = 2π/ω

PARAMETERS:
- Mass m = 1.0 kg
- Spring constant k = 1.0 N/m
- Initial displacement x₀ = 1.0 m
- Initial velocity v₀ = 0.0 m/s

CONCLUSION:
Our results show that simple harmonic oscillators exhibit perfect energy conservation in ideal conditions, validating classical mechanics principles for this fundamental system.
