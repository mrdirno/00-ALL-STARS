# Grid Resolution Independence Validation Report

**Test Date**: 2024-12-29
**Galaxies**: 1,821,322
**Primary Scale**: 63 Mpc

## Executive Summary

**Verdict**: INCONSISTENT - Strong resolution dependence (possible artifact)
**Confidence**: LOW

## Detailed Results

| Resolution | 3-4:2 Score | Total Correlation | Computation Time |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 16³ | 0.903998 | 0.011542 | 0.1s |
| 32³ | 0.798007 | 0.002721 | 0.1s |
| 48³ | 0.799285 | 0.000251 | 0.1s |

## Statistical Analysis

**3-4:2 Score Statistics**:
- Mean: 0.833763
- Standard Deviation: 0.049666
- Coefficient of Variation: 0.060
- Trend with Resolution: -0.00327228

**Total Correlation Statistics**:
- Mean: 0.004838
- Standard Deviation: 0.004847
- Coefficient of Variation: 1.002
- Trend with Resolution: -0.00035285

**Interpretation**:
- High CV (1.002) indicates poor consistency across resolutions
- Total correlation drops by 46x from 16³ to 48³ resolution
- Pattern may be resolution-dependent artifact
- Requires further investigation

## CRITICAL CONCERNS

### 1. Signal Degradation with Resolution
- **16³ → 32³**: 76% correlation drop
- **32³ → 48³**: 91% correlation drop  
- **Overall**: 98% signal loss from lowest to highest resolution

### 2. Physical Implausibility
- Real cosmic structure should **strengthen** with higher resolution
- Observing **opposite trend** suggests numerical artifact
- Grid spacing effects dominating real signal

### 3. Statistical Significance
- Original 2x enhancement may be grid-dependent
- Need to retest random controls at all resolutions
- Multiple testing correction required

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS
1. **Halt Publication Preparations** - Discovery not validated
2. **Rerun Random Controls** at 32³ and 48³ resolutions
3. **Alternative Analysis Methods** - Different gridding approaches
4. **Expert Consultation** - Independent validation needed

### ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES
1. **Adaptive Mesh Refinement** - Non-uniform grids
2. **Particle-Based Analysis** - Direct N-body methods
3. **Wavelet Analysis** - Scale-independent transforms
4. **Traditional Power Spectrum** - Cross-validation

## CONCLUSION

The sawtooth discovery **FAILS** the grid resolution independence test. The dramatic signal degradation with increased resolution strongly suggests the pattern is a **numerical artifact** rather than genuine cosmic structure.

**Status**: Discovery **INVALIDATED** pending further investigation.
**Next Steps**: Alternative validation methods required.
