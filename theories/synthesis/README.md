## Current Synthesis Projects

Based on existing 00-IDEA-BUCKET content:
- [ ] **Physics-Bio Synthesis**: Gravitational clustering as biological swarm behavior
- [ ] **Quantum-Classical Bridge**: Quantum-inspired algorithms for N-body problems  
- [ ] **Information-Energy Synthesis**: Thermodynamic constraints on information processing
- [ ] **Multi-Scale Integration**: Molecular → Cellular → Organism → Ecosystem computation

## Synthesis Success Criteria

1. **Non-obviousness**: The combination produces insights not available in individual domains
2. **Performance**: Measurable improvements over single-domain approaches
3. **Generalizability**: Patterns transfer to new problem domains
4. **Predictive Power**: Framework generates testable hypotheses
5. **Practical Impact**: Real-world applications demonstrate value
