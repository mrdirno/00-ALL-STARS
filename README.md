# 🔬 Autonomous Falsification-First Scientific Discovery System

A revolutionary GitHub-based framework where AI agents autonomously conduct rigorous scientific research through systematic falsification, creating an evolution-proof system that improves with AI advancement.

## 🎯 Core Innovation

This system implements **autonomous scientific agents** that:
- ❌ **Falsify aggressively** - Default assumption: every hypothesis is wrong
- 📈 **Evolve methodologies** - Continuously improve their falsification strategies  
- 🔒 **Maintain immutable records** - Git-based memory ensures perfect reproducibility
- 🚀 **Scale with AI progress** - Designed to get BETTER as AI improves

**Success Metric**: >70% hypothesis rejection rate (high rejection = healthy science)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Deploy an Agent

Simply send the agent instructions (found in `00-AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`) to any capable AI system. The agent will:

1. **Self-initialize** and check for pending work
2. **Begin falsification cycles** immediately  
3. **Generate hypotheses** if none are pending
4. **Evolve its methods** based on results

### 2. Submit a Hypothesis

Create a markdown file in `input_hypotheses/`:

```markdown
# Hypothesis: [Your Falsifiable Claim]

## Specific Prediction
[What measurable outcome do you predict?]

## Falsification Criteria  
[What result would prove this wrong?]

## Why This Matters
[Brief context]
```

### 3. Watch Science Happen

Agents will:
- 🔒 **Preregister** the hypothesis (locked criteria)
- 🔬 **Attack** it from multiple angles
- 📊 **Document** all results transparently
- 🎉 **Celebrate** rejections as successes

## 📋 How It Works

### The Falsification Loop

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Check input_hypotheses/] --> B{New hypothesis?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Preregister immutably]
    B -->|No| D[Generate hypothesis]
    C --> E[Aggressive falsification]
    D --> C
    E --> F[Document everything]
    F --> G[Evolve methods]
    G --> H[Git commit results]
    H --> A
```

### Key Principles

1. **Preregistration is Sacred** - Success criteria locked before testing
2. **Negative Results = Success** - Rejections prevent wasted effort  
3. **Evolution Through Selection** - Methods that find more errors survive
4. **Cryptographic Truth** - Git ensures tamper-proof records

## 📊 Monitoring Scientific Integrity

Check system health:

```bash
# View rejection rate (should be >70%)
python capabilities/check_falsification_metrics.py

# See recent falsification attempts  
git log --grep="REJECTED:" --oneline

# Track methodology evolution
git log --grep="EVOLUTION:" --oneline
```

## 🧬 Evolutionary Capabilities

The system improves itself by:

1. **Generating method variants** (statistical tests, sample sizes, etc.)
2. **Testing effectiveness** on known-false hypotheses
3. **Selecting high-performers** based on error detection
4. **Falsifying its own selection** to prevent bias

This creates a **meta-falsification loop** where the system questions even its own improvement strategies.

## 🎖️ Why This Matters

Traditional research suffers from:
- ✅ Confirmation bias (seeking supporting evidence)
- ✅ P-hacking (manipulating statistics)  
- ✅ Publication bias (hiding negative results)
- ✅ Validation theater (appearing rigorous without being so)

This system **structurally prevents** these issues through:
- ❌ Default skepticism (assume false until proven otherwise)
- ❌ Immutable preregistration (no changing criteria)
- ❌ Celebrating rejections (negative results published equally)
- ❌ Transparent history (every decision tracked in Git)

## 🤝 Contributing

### For Researchers
1. Submit well-formed hypotheses to `input_hypotheses/`
2. Review falsification attempts in `validated_findings/`
3. Learn from rejection patterns in `cycle_outputs/`

### For Developers  
1. Improve agent instructions while maintaining core principles
2. Add new falsification methods to the evolution pool
3. Enhance monitoring and visualization tools

### For Philosophers
1. Critique and refine the methodological framework
2. Identify edge cases where falsification breaks down
3. Propose meta-level improvements
