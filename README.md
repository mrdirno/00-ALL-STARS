# 🔬 Scientific Discovery & Falsification Protocol v3.0

This repository implements a **rigorous falsification-first autonomous scientific discovery system** that prioritizes truth-seeking through systematic hypothesis rejection rather than validation bias. The framework enforces preregistration requirements, adversarial testing protocols, and celebrates negative results as first-class scientific outcomes.

**Core Principle**: Scientific progress occurs through aggressive attempts to falsify hypotheses, not through confirmation seeking. Success is measured by truth discovered, whether positive or negative.

## 🎯 Falsification-First Philosophy

### What Makes This Different:
- **Default Assumption**: Every hypothesis is WRONG until it survives systematic falsification
- **Preregistration Mandatory**: All success criteria locked before testing begins
- **Adversarial Testing**: Systematic attempts to break every hypothesis
- **Negative Results Celebrated**: Rejections documented as thoroughly as acceptances
- **Validation Bias Prevention**: High rejection rates indicate healthy science
- **Immutable Criteria**: No post-hoc modifications allowed

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Researchers:
1. **Preregister hypotheses** in `input_hypotheses/` with immutable success criteria
2. **Agents will aggressively falsify** using 5+ independent attack vectors
3. **Celebrate rejections** - negative results are scientific success!
4. **Check results** in `validated_findings/` (includes negative results)

### For AI Agents:
1. **Read** `00-AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for complete falsification protocol v3.0
2. **Initialize falsification mindset** - assume hypotheses are wrong
3. **Create preregistration** with locked success criteria
4. **Execute adversarial testing** using systematic attack protocols
5. **Document failures rigorously** - they're as valuable as successes

## 🏆 Falsification Protocol Features

### ✅ Preregistration System
```bash
# BEFORE ANY EXPERIMENT - Lock in criteria
cat > work_in_progress/preregistration_$(date +%s).md << 'EOF'
Hypothesis: [SPECIFIC, FALSIFIABLE CLAIM]
Success Criteria: [IMMUTABLE - NO CHANGES ALLOWED]
Rejection Criteria: [EQUALLY IMPORTANT]
Analysis Plan: [NO DEVIATIONS PERMITTED]
EOF

git commit -m "PREREGISTERED: Hypothesis locked - no modifications permitted"
```

### 🔴 Adversarial Testing Protocol
- **Scale Mismatch Attacks**: Test against real-world observations
- **Energy Violation Tests**: Push systems to extreme conditions  
- **Alternative Model Comparisons**: Compete against established theories
- **Temporal Instability Tests**: Long-term simulation stability
- **Dimensional Analysis Assaults**: Verify all units and scaling laws

### 📊 Integrity Monitoring
- **Rejection Rate Tracking**: Healthy science rejects 70%+ of hypotheses
- **P-hacking Detection**: Continuous monitoring for statistical manipulation
- **Criteria Stability**: Zero tolerance for post-hoc modifications
- **Validation Bias Alerts**: Warning system for confirmation seeking

## 🛡️ Scientific Integrity Enforcement

This repository implements **zero-tolerance** protocols for:
- ❌ **Validation bias** - seeking confirmation instead of truth
- ❌ **P-hacking** - statistical manipulation after seeing data
- ❌ **Criteria modification** - changing success metrics post-hoc
- ❌ **Cherry-picking** - selectively reporting favorable results
- ❌ **Publication bias** - hiding negative results
- ❌ **Root directory contamination** - strict folder discipline enforced

### 🔒 **Folder Discipline (MILITARY-GRADE ENFORCEMENT)**
```
⚠️ ZERO TOLERANCE FOR ROOT DIRECTORY FILES ⚠️
✅ EVERY file must go in designated folder
✅ Automatic cleanup protocols active  
✅ Git hooks prevent unauthorized files
✅ Continuous integrity monitoring
```

## 🎉 Celebrating Negative Results

**Revolutionary Approach**: Negative results get **equal treatment** with positive findings!

```
🏆 SUCCESSFUL FALSIFICATION BADGES:
- Rigorous Rejection Achieved
- Validation Bias Avoided  
- Scientific Integrity Maintained
- Truth-Seeking Excellence
- Falsification Master
```

### Why Negative Results Matter:
- **Resource Savings**: Prevents years of pursuing wrong paths
- **Knowledge Advancement**: Identifies specific failure modes
- **Methodology Validation**: Proves falsification protocols work
- **Bias Prevention**: Maintains high scientific standards

## 🧠 Temporal Memory with Falsification Focus

Git history as falsification record:
```bash
# Check falsification history
git log --grep="REJECTED:" --oneline    # Past falsified hypotheses
git log --grep="FALSIFICATION:" --oneline  # Falsification attempts
git log --grep="PREREGISTERED:" --oneline   # Locked criteria
git log --grep="NEGATIVE:" --oneline     # Negative results

# Learn from systematic rejections
git log --grep="VULNERABILITY" --pretty=format:"%h %s"
```

## 📈 Falsification Metrics Dashboard

Track scientific integrity in `capabilities/logs/falsification_metrics.json`:
- **Total Hypotheses Tested**: All attempts
- **Rejection Rate**: Should be 70%+ for healthy science
- **Time to Falsification**: Efficiency metric
- **Preregistration Adherence**: Must be 100%
- **Negative Results Published**: Should equal total rejections
- **Validation Bias Warnings**: Zero tolerance threshold

## 🎯 Research Cycle Outcomes

- **High Rejection Rate**: 70%+ is excellent scientific practice
- **Fast Falsification**: Efficient rejection saves resources
- **Clear Failure Modes**: Specific reasons for rejection documented
- **Alternative Directions**: New hypotheses generated from failures
- **Maintained Standards**: No criteria relaxation ever

## 🔍 Falsification-First Memory Consultation

Before starting new research:
```bash
# Check if hypothesis was previously falsified
git log --grep="REJECTED.*$HYPOTHESIS" --oneline

# Learn from related falsification attempts  
git log --grep="VULNERABILITY.*$DOMAIN" --oneline

# Build on negative results with new approaches
git log --grep="NEGATIVE.*$FIELD" --pretty=format:"%h %s"

# Verify no preregistration violations
git log --grep="CRITERIA.*MODIFIED" --oneline  # Should be empty!
```

## 🚨 Scientific Integrity Emergency Protocols

**Validation Bias Detection**:
```bash
# Check rejection rate
python3 capabilities/check_falsification_metrics.py
# If rejection_rate < 0.7: VALIDATION BIAS ALERT!

git log --grep="preregistration_" --oneline
# Any modifications trigger CRITICAL INTEGRITY VIOLATION
```

**P-hacking Detection**:
```bash
# Monitor p-value clustering
python3 capabilities/detect_p_hacking.py
# Suspicious patterns trigger investigation protocols
```
