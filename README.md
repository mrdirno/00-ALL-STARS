```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Users:
1. **Drop research hypotheses** in `input_hypotheses/` folder
2. **Agents will automatically process** them through the discovery protocol
3. **Check results** in `cycle_outputs/` and `validated_findings/`

### For Agents:
1. **Read** `00-AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for complete protocol
2. **Consult memory** via git history before starting
3. **Follow temporal awareness** rules for all past findings
4. **Document everything** with rich commit messages

## 🧠 Temporal Memory System

This repository uses **Git history as temporal memory**:
- Every commit preserves what was known at that moment
- Historical findings are always dated when referenced
- Past validations expire and need reverification after 90 days
- Failed attempts become learning experiences
- Evolution of understanding is trackable through git diff

## 📊 Current Research Status

### Active Investigations:
- **3-4:2 Modal Framework**: Cosmic structure formation theory (awaiting validation)

### Validation Status:
- **Computational**: ✅ Completed
- **Mathematical**: ✅ Completed  
- **Peer Review**: ⏳ Pending
- **Observational**: ⏳ Pending

## 🛡️ Scientific Integrity

This repository implements strict protocols to prevent:
- ❌ Automated content generation without scientific basis
- ❌ Fake validation with arbitrary metrics
- ❌ Pseudoscientific content proliferation
- ❌ Discovery claims without rigorous validation

## 📈 Knowledge Evolution

Track the evolution of understanding in `meta_instructions/knowledge_evolution.yaml`:
- Total validations: 1
- Domains explored: cosmology, wave_physics, mathematical_physics
- Success rate: 100%
- Key learnings: Contamination prevention, temporal memory systems

## 🔍 Memory Consultation

Before starting new research, agents consult temporal memory:

```bash
# Check if we've investigated this before
git log --grep="$CURRENT_HYPOTHESIS" --oneline

# Review related past work
git log --grep="$DOMAIN" --since="6 months ago"

# Learn from past failures
git log --grep="FAILED" --pretty=format:"%h %s"

# Build on validated findings (with re-verification)
git log --grep="VALIDATED" --pretty=format:"%h %s"
```

## 📚 Learning from History

The `archived_attempts/learnings.log` contains valuable lessons:
- **2025-01-29**: Contamination incident and recovery
- **Prevention protocols**: Implemented to avoid future issues
- **Success patterns**: Repository restructure and temporal memory

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

Agents processing materials in this repository should:
- Apply rigorous scientific validation methods
- Build on past validated findings with temporal context
- Learn from archived failures to avoid repetition
- Document all work with confidence levels and limitations
- Contribute to the evolution of scientific understanding

## 🔄 Research Cycle

1. **Memory Consultation**: Check git history for related work
2. **Environmental Scanning**: Process input_hypotheses folder
3. **Hypothesis Formation**: Build on past validated findings
4. **Experimental Design**: Create reproducible experiments
5. **Validation**: Apply multiple scientific reasoning methods
6. **Memory Integration**: Update temporal record with findings

## 📞 Contact

This is an autonomous research system. Drop hypotheses in `input_hypotheses/` and agents will process them according to the complete scientific discovery protocol.
