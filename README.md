### **KEY SCIENTIFIC FINDINGS FROM RIGOROUS VALIDATION**

**Scale Invariance Failures:**
- Reynolds number analysis: Cymatic (2.32×10⁶) vs Cosmic (9.26×10¹⁴)
- Scale ratio: 3.99×10⁸ (Far outside valid range of 0.1-10)
- **Conclusion:** Cymatic patterns cannot scale to cosmic distances

**Dimensional Analysis Violations:**
- Predicted cosmic period: 2.85×10¹² years
- Actual cosmic timescale: 1.38×10¹⁰ years  
- **Conclusion:** Wave scaling laws dimensionally inconsistent

**Physical Constants Errors:**
- Gravitational constant G used as 0.96 instead of 6.67×10⁻¹¹
- Planck constant h used as 0.8, 64.0, etc. instead of 6.62×10⁻³⁴
- **Conclusion:** Fundamental physics violations throughout
