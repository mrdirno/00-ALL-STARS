## EXPLORATION FOCUS

### Primary Research Question
Do quantum coherence effects in biological systems follow predictable patterns that could be leveraged for technological applications?

### Specific Investigation Areas
1. **Quantum coherence persistence in warm, noisy biological environments**
2. **Microtubule quantum information processing capabilities**
3. **Photosynthetic quantum efficiency mechanisms**
4. **Quantum entanglement in neural networks**
5. **Biological quantum error correction mechanisms**

## HYPOTHESIS GENERATION

### Target Hypothesis: Biological Quantum Error Correction
**Specific Claim**: Living cells utilize quantum error correction mechanisms analogous to quantum computers, enabling coherent quantum states to persist in warm biological environments for functionally relevant timescales (>1ms).

### Theoretical Foundation
- Quantum biology observations show surprising coherence persistence
- Error correction is known requirement for quantum computation
- Biological systems demonstrate remarkable error tolerance
- Evolution could have optimized quantum error correction

### Falsifiable Predictions
1. **Coherence Time Scaling**: Biological quantum coherence should scale with system complexity (more complex → longer coherence)
2. **Temperature Independence**: Error correction should maintain coherence across biological temperature ranges
3. **Noise Resilience**: Biological quantum states should survive environmental perturbations better than synthetic systems
4. **Metabolic Coupling**: Quantum coherence should correlate with metabolic energy availability
5. **Evolutionary Conservation**: Quantum error correction mechanisms should be conserved across species

## PREREGISTRATION PLANNING

### Immutable Success Criteria (To Be Locked)
- **Primary Endpoint**: Demonstration of active error correction in biological quantum systems
- **Statistical Threshold**: p < 0.01 (strict falsification standard)
- **Effect Size**: Cohen's d > 0.5 (meaningful biological difference)
- **Sample Size**: N = 50 independent biological systems minimum

### Rejection Criteria (Equally Important)
- **Coherence Time**: <1ms average coherence time → IMMEDIATE TERMINATION
- **Temperature Sensitivity**: >10x degradation at physiological temperature → TERMINATION
- **Energy Cost**: >50% of cellular ATP budget required → TERMINATION
- **Conservation Violation**: Absence in >3 phylogenetically distant species → TERMINATION
- **Alternative Explanation**: Classical mechanisms explain >90% of observed effects → TERMINATION

### Planned Attack Vectors (Falsification-First)
1. **Thermal Destruction Test**: Can thermal noise destroy coherence?
2. **Metabolic Inhibition**: Does ATP depletion eliminate quantum effects?
3. **Evolutionary Knockout**: Do organisms lacking key proteins lose coherence?
4. **Scaling Failure**: Do larger biological systems lose quantum advantages?
5. **Classical Simulation**: Can classical models reproduce all observations?
