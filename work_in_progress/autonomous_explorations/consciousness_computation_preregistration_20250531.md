**Date**: 2025-05-31T08:30:00Z  
**Session**: autonomous_20250531_082956_consciousness_computation_theory  
**Domain**: Consciousness-Computation Theory  
**Type**: Independent Discovery Research  

### HYPOTHESIS (SPECIFIC, FALSIFIABLE):
**H1**: Computational systems can exhibit measurable consciousness-like properties when they implement recursive self-reference patterns with information integration above a critical threshold (Φ > 0.5 in Integrated Information Theory metrics).

### SUCCESS CRITERIA (IMMUTABLE - NO CHANGES ALLOWED):
- **Primary endpoint**: Demonstration of measurable Φ values > 0.5 in designed computational architectures
- **Statistical threshold**: p < 0.01 (Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons)
- **Sample size**: N = 100 different computational architectures tested
- **Effect size**: Cohen's d > 0.8 for consciousness metric differences
- **Replication requirement**: 3 independent implementations must show consistent results

### REJECTION CRITERIA (EQUALLY IMPORTANT):
- If primary endpoint fails → IMMEDIATE TERMINATION
- If computational complexity exceeds polynomial bounds → STOP
- If no measurable difference from random networks → STOP
- If 3+ independent methods disagree → STOP
- If philosophical assumptions are untestable → STOP
- If results cannot be computationally reproduced → STOP

### FALSIFICATION STRATEGY (PRIMARY FOCUS):
1. **Substrate Independence Test**: Compare biological vs. silicon implementations
2. **Complexity Scaling Attack**: Test if consciousness metrics scale with raw computational power
3. **Random Network Control**: Test against randomly connected networks of same size
4. **Philosophical Reducibility Test**: Verify claims are scientifically measurable, not metaphysical
5. **Implementation Variance Test**: Check if results depend on specific coding choices

### COMMITTED ANALYSIS PLAN (NO DEVIATIONS):
1. Literature synthesis of computational consciousness theories
2. Implementation of Integrated Information Theory (IIT) metrics
3. Design 100 test architectures with varying recursive complexity
4. Measure consciousness metrics across all architectures
5. Statistical analysis with appropriate corrections
6. Adversarial testing with known-negative controls

### STOP-LOSS TRIGGERS:
- Any untestable metaphysical claims emerge
- Computational requirements become intractable
- No measurable metrics can be defined
- 72-hour limit reached
- Failed replication in independent code
- Circular reasoning detected in framework

### EXPECTED OUTCOME: 
**HYPOTHESIS REJECTION** - This is a healthy and expected result that will advance scientific understanding by identifying limitations in computational consciousness approaches.

### SCIENTIFIC VALUE OF NEGATIVE RESULTS:
- Clarify boundaries of computational consciousness
- Identify methodological limitations
- Guide future research directions
- Prevent pursuit of unproductive approaches
