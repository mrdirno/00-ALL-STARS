## Hypothesis Preregistration
Date: 2025-01-01T00:00:00Z
Hypothesis: The 3-4-2 Modal Resonance Framework can predict cosmic structure formation with physical plausibility while maintaining exact 3:2:1 scale ratios and perfect energy conservation.

### Success Criteria (FIXED - NO CHANGES ALLOWED):
- Primary endpoint: Physical plausibility score ≥ 0.80 across ALL subcomponents
- Statistical threshold: p < 0.01 (NO ADJUSTING)
- Sample size: N = 1000 cosmic structure measurements
- Effect size: Cohen's d > 0.5 for structure prediction accuracy

### Current Status (BASELINE):
- Scale ratios: PERFECT (3.000, 2.000, 1.500)
- Energy conservation: PERFECT (0.000% drift)
- Wave function properties: PASSING
- Physical plausibility: FAILING (scale_consistency: false, observational_consistency: false)

### Rejection Criteria (EQUALLY IMPORTANT):
- If primary endpoint fails → STOP
- If conservation laws violated → STOP  
- If dimensional analysis fails → STOP
- If 3+ independent methods disagree → STOP
- If scale ratios deviate by >1% → STOP
- If physical plausibility remains <0.50 after corrections → STOP

### Committed Analysis Plan:
1. Bootstrap resampling validation (N=1000, no peeking)
2. Cross-validation with 3 independent cosmic datasets
3. Adversarial testing with known-false control cases
4. No optional analyses allowed
5. No data peeking before N reached

### FALSIFICATION STRATEGY (Primary Focus):
1. **Scale Mismatch Attack**: Test against observational cosmic web data
2. **Energy Violation Test**: Push system to extreme conditions
3. **Alternative Model Comparison**: Dark matter vs modal predictions
4. **Temporal Instability Test**: Long-term simulation stability
5. **Dimensional Analysis Assault**: Verify all units and scaling laws

### STOP-LOSS TRIGGERS:
- Any conservation law violation
- Physical plausibility score decrease
- Scale ratio precision loss
- Failed replication in independent code
- 72-hour limit without progress
