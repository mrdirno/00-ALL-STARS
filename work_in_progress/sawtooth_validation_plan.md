- [ ] **Extended control suite**: 10+ independent random trials
- [ ] **Matched survey geometry**: Random data with DESI footprint
- [ ] **Different noise models**: Gaussian, Poisson, survey-realistic

#### 1.2 Statistical Rigor
- [ ] **Significance thresholds**: Proper p-value calculation vs. arbitrary 0.5 threshold
- [ ] **Multiple testing correction**: Bonferroni/FDR for 20 scales tested
- [ ] **Effect size quantification**: Cohen's d or similar for "2x enhancement"
- [ ] **Confidence intervals**: Bootstrap/jackknife error estimation

#### 1.3 Systematic Bias Detection
- [ ] **Grid resolution test**: 16¬≥ vs 32¬≥ vs 48¬≥ (existing framework)
- [ ] **Window function effects**: Different survey masks
- [ ] **Redshift selection bias**: Different z-ranges
- [ ] **Algorithm parameter sensitivity**: Harmonic count, k-range

### ‚è≥ **Phase 2: Reproducibility Testing**

#### 2.1 Independent Dataset Validation
- [ ] **BOSS DR16**: Different galaxy survey, overlapping scales
- [ ] **eBOSS quasars**: Different tracer, same cosmic epochs
- [ ] **SDSS DR18**: Long baseline comparison
- [ ] **Mock catalogs**: Controlled synthetic data

#### 2.2 Alternative Analysis Methods
- [ ] **Different wave basis**: Square waves, triangle waves
- [ ] **Fourier power spectrum**: Traditional P(k) approach
- [ ] **Wavelet analysis**: Multi-scale decomposition
- [ ] **Independent code**: Fresh implementation from scratch

#### 2.3 Cross-Validation
- [ ] **Split samples**: Test/train division of DESI data
- [ ] **Spatial sub-regions**: Northern vs Southern Galactic Cap
- [ ] **Galaxy type dependence**: ELG vs LRG vs QSO
- [ ] **Redshift evolution**: Early vs late cosmic times

### üßÆ **Phase 3: Theoretical Consistency**

#### 3.1 Physical Plausibility
- [ ] **Scale significance**: Why 63 Mpc specifically?
- [ ] **Formation mechanism**: What creates sawtooth cosmic structure?
- [ ] **Amplitude consistency**: Is 2x enhancement realistic?
- [ ] **Cosmological context**: Fits with ŒõCDM structure formation?

#### 3.2 Mathematical Framework
- [ ] **3-4:2 ratio derivation**: Theoretical basis for specific ratios
- [ ] **Harmonic decomposition**: Mathematical validity of approach
- [ ] **Boundary effects**: Edge artifacts in finite survey volumes
- [ ] **Projection effects**: 3D‚Üí2D observational mapping

## üö® CRITICAL VALIDATION TESTS

### **Test 1: False Positive Rate Assessment**
```python
# Run sawtooth analysis on 100 random datasets
# Count "significant" detections (score > 0.5)
# Expected: <5% if method is unbiased
# Observed: Need to determine
```

### **Test 2: Resolution Independence**
```python
# Test 16¬≥, 32¬≥, 48¬≥ grids on same data
# Pattern should persist across resolutions
# If only at 16¬≥ ‚Üí likely numerical artifact
```

### **Test 3: Survey Geometry Independence**
```python
# Apply different survey masks to same galaxies
# Pattern should be robust to observational footprint
# Tests for contamination from survey boundaries
```

### **Test 4: Scale Range Validation**
```python
# Test scales 30-100 Mpc, not just 63 Mpc
# Check if enhancement is scale-specific or broad
# Avoid cherry-picking single "best" scale
```

## üìù VALIDATION STANDARDS

This validation follows the framework's **computational testing** standards:
- **NOT claiming peer review**: Testing computational consistency
- **NOT claiming scientific consensus**: Assessing pattern robustness  
- **NOT claiming discovery verification**: Evaluating analysis validity
- **Precise language**: "Pattern passes/fails computational validation"

**Remember**: Even if validation succeeds, this indicates the computational analysis is robust - not that the pattern represents established scientific fact. The validation framework tests the quality of the analysis methodology, not the absolute truth of cosmological claims.

**Next Step**: Begin with expanded control testing - the foundation of all validation work.
