## üèÜ NEGATIVE RESULTS (CELEBRATED!)

### **Rejected Hypothesis**: 3-4-2 Modal Framework for Cosmic Structure Formation

**Falsification Method**: Systematic adversarial testing (5 attack vectors)

**Critical Vulnerabilities Discovered**:
1. **Scale Mismatch**: Wrong by 15+ orders of magnitude
2. **Energy Violation**: Conservation breaks under extreme conditions  
3. **Dimensional Analysis**: Undefined units in coupling constants

**Lessons Learned**:
- Scale matching is essential for cosmic models
- Mathematical elegance ‚â† Physical validity
- Dimensional consistency is non-negotiable
- Extreme testing reveals hidden failures

**Time Saved**: Prevented years of pursuing fundamentally flawed approach

**Future Directions**: 
- Investigate cosmological frequency scaling
- Derive coupling constants from first principles
- Consider quantum field theory foundations
